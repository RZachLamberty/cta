## notes on data sources
I have collected the bounding points of the city of Chicago into a csv file. However, they were originally found in a KML file created by Jonathan Levy. His map project can be found [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-City/ewy2-6yfk)

I also used modifed the l station and l rail line kml files to my advantage. These were also obtained through the city of chicago data portal at the following websites:

+ [L rail stations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-L-Rail-Stations-KML-Deprecated-February-2015-/bs96-uama?)
+ [L rail lines](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-L-Rail-Lines-KML-Deprecated-February-2015-/m3d6-pubu?)
